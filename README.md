"This project is a functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The HTML provides the foundational structure for the buttons and display screen.
CSS is used to design a clean, responsive user interface and ensure a user-friendly layout.
All the core arithmetic logic, including handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display, is managed by the JavaScript code."
